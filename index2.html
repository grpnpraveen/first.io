                        <p>Gravity Points may be a digital "pen" created by Akimitsu Hamamuro, and it's quite mesmerizing. The website simulates the effect of gravity by allowing you to plot small gravity centers across your screen. Then, even smaller floating objects will flock to those gravity centers and orbit them.
                    The more gravity centers you plot, the more these forces will start to compete, making your screen all the more chaotic. And yes, your gravity points can absorb each other to make a region . It's space right there on your display screen .

                              There's more than 280 million people posting to Twitter, and an interesting new art project is using those tweets to tell you the time. It's called All The Minutes, and it's a web clock that pulls from the world's past and present tweets to offer you a minute-by-minute glimpse at what people are up to.

    <div class="pointer">
        <a href="https://pointerpointer.com/" target="_blank"><h1>5.Pointer pointer</h1></a><p> Pointer Pointer is sort of possibly one among the foremost useless websites we've ever seen and one we just can't get enough of.
We know who made it, but we do not know why, or how. You know what? That's OK. We like the idea that it's just there.
What it does is locate your cursor and find an image with people pointing towards that location on the screen. We've been twiddling with it for a short time now, and haven't seen an equivalent picture twice.
How can an internet site that's so filled with pointing be so utterly pointless? We don't know. We just don't know. </p></div>
